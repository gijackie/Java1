	int n = i++%5; //Remember, when ++ is to the right, it adds one after the fact.
	
	a.  What are the values of i and n after the code is executed?
		i = 11;
		n = 0;
	b.  What are the final values of i and n if instead of using the postfix increment operator (i++), you use the prefix version (++i)?
		i = 11;
		n = 1;
