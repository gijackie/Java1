//2.In the following program, explain why the value "6" is printed twice in a row:
 class PrePostDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int i = 3;
        i++;
        System.out.println(i);    // "4"
        ++i;                     
        System.out.println(i);    // "5"
        System.out.println(++i);  // "6"//i = 5, and here we add 1 to 5 because the ++ is before the i, making i 6
        System.out.println(i++);  // "6"//and here we come in with i = 6, and since the ++ is after the i, i still equals 6 and on the next one...
        System.out.println(i);    // "7"//the 1 is added to i from the previous post increment.
    }
}
